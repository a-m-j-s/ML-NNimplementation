# ML-NNimplemantation
The first project, in files named 68-1, has two problems:
- Using the the iris dataset (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html), two implementations of neural networks with different cost functions and initializations are compared. 
- Using the Breast cancer data set from UCI (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) a neural network is implemented using keras. One hidden layer is used, different activation and loss fucntions are tested along with different regularization methods.
The pdf has the project report and the other file has the code. It was made in 3 days (and it invlod learing python, and all the libraries, along with the ml concepts, so the code is a bit confusing)

The second project, in the files named 68-2, the fuits dataset from kaggle is used (https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits). A pretrained CNN neural network is used (MolibeNET https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) with added layers that we train.
